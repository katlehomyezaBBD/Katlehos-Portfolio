       <p>I am a 21 year old originating from a Zulu dad and a Sotho mother in the city of gold, Johannesburg.
        My tech journey was not one of relative length, I never was really a tech prodigee per se in the beginning. I had my first intro 
       was the typical tedious Scratch in grade 8,however, in grade 10 as my school had a computer science module
     and the teacher is someone I talk to to this day. Since that say, he took us from concepts like types of storage, hardware vs Software
    to python and from there Its been debugging throughout
I decided to step it up a notch and registered for a BsC at Wits University, however, I had to fight my way and beg
to be put into Computer Science, in which I somehow graduated in 2024 with all the skills I have gotten that will hopefully carry me until
the very end </p>
