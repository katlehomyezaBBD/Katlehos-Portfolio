        <p>I am a 21-year-old son of a Zulu father and a Sotho mother, raised in Johannesburg, also known as the City of Gold. My journey in technology began later than most, and I wouldn't consider myself a prodigy. My introduction to tech came in Grade 8, where I experienced the fundamentals through the Scratch programming language. However, it wasn't until Grade 10, when my school introduced a computer science subject, that my passion for technology truly ignited. I was fortunate to have an inspiring teacher, who I still keep in touch with to this day, guiding us through the easy fundamentals, such as types of storage,  hardware vs software, and ultimately, Python . Since then, my focus has been on learning, problem-solving, and honing my skills through the process of debugging.
            Determined to pursue my passion further, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science program at Wits University. Although I faced some initial challenges and had to advocate for myself to be placed in the Computer Science track, I came a  boy and left a man, graduated in 2024. The skills I have acquired during this time will serve me throughout my career(I hope) as I continue to grow in the tech industry.</p>
